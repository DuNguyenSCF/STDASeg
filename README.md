# STDASeg
This repository is dedicated to sharing the materials and code related to our ***under reviewed*** journal paper: "**A novel self-training approach for structural crack detection using image blendingbased domain mixing and mutual learning (Quang Du Nguyen, Huu-Tai Thai, and Son Dong Nguyen)**". In this paper, 
a self-training framework for domain adaptive crack segmentation (STDASeg) is proposed. STDASeg aims to enhance crack detection in civil infrastructure by leveraging image *blending-based techniques for domain mixing* and *CNN-Transformer mutual learning for self-training*, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling.
